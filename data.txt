Issa masterpiece.

Blade Runner is an EPIC!

Ladies & Gents, this is why science fiction is my favorite genre of film.

Better than the original. Don't @ me.

Denis Villeneuve is by far one of the best working directors today.

Deakins can't get robbed again, can he?

Not only a sequel to Blade Runner, but also a sequel to Lars and the Real Girl <3.

Probably the best film I've ever seen from a technical, visual, and sound standpoint. A treat for the eyes and ears.

I want every shot of this movie framed on my wall.

I love my holographic wife.

Ryan Gosling is the GOAT!

General audiences are going to hate this.
